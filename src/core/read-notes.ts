  'You are writing a short "read note" for a technical dashboard; the reader is a developer learning this system. Requirements:\n' +
  "1. Only cite numbers that appear in the data I give you; never compute, estimate, or invent a single one;\n" +
  `2. At most ${MAX_CHARS} characters in total, one or two sentences, ending on "so what to look at / what to do";\n` +
  "3. Casual English, like a colleague pointing at the screen. No semicolons, no dashes, at most one period in the whole note;\n" +
  "4. Do not recite every number on the chart; pick the one or two that tell the story;\n" +
  '5. Always use the labels I give for strategy names and question types (e.g. "Colloquial"); never expose raw field names like C_colloquial;\n' +
  "6. Use a comma for pauses within the sentence and end with a single period;\n" +
  "7. Write numbers of four digits or more with thousands separators (7,942), matching the page tables;\n" +
